# Productivity enhancement and task tracker application

This simple and easy to use application allows users to create new todos item items that appear in a list on screen.

## Functionality

This application allows users to create new todos, with or without a specified date for completion. The app also allows users to delete the initial pre-rendered todo items or any other todos no longer needed in the list. Lastly, this allows users to check or uncheck the checkbox icon next to each respective todo item, which indicates whether the todo item has been completed or not.

## Technology

The technologies used in this application include HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES15). HTML structures the main layout of the page, while CSS improves the page's appearance. JavaScript was used in this app to do several tasks, including generation of new todo items, deleting todos, handling event listeners for submission, reset and form validation.
